**Repository**: https://github.com/akaoio/access

## üéØ Educational Mission

Learn DNS synchronization patterns, POSIX shell mastery, and eternal infrastructure design

## üìñ What You'll Learn

Access is the eternal foundation - while applications come and go, Access ensures your DNS always points home.

Access is the perfect educational platform for learning eternal infrastructure design. This documentation teaches you not just HOW to use Access, but WHY it works and HOW to apply these patterns in your own projects.

## üèóÔ∏è Core Architecture Principles (Learn by Example)


### Pure Shell Promise

**Technical Implementation**: NEVER requires Node.js, Python, Go, Rust, NPM, pip, cargo, compilation, transpilation, or build steps. Only POSIX shell and provider CLIs.

**What You'll Learn**: Master pure POSIX shell programming without modern dependencies


‚≠ê **Critical Concept**: This principle forms the foundation of all eternal infrastructure design.



### Zero Dependencies Philosophy

**Technical Implementation**: Uses only standard POSIX utilities (sh, curl/wget, dig/nslookup, cron) and provider-specific CLIs

**What You'll Learn**: Understand how to build robust systems with minimal dependencies


‚≠ê **Critical Concept**: This principle forms the foundation of all eternal infrastructure design.



### Single Responsibility

**Technical Implementation**: Does ONE thing extremely well - IP synchronization with DNS providers. No feature creep allowed.

**What You'll Learn**: Learn Unix philosophy of single-purpose tools done perfectly


‚≠ê **Critical Concept**: This principle forms the foundation of all eternal infrastructure design.



### Eternal Infrastructure

**Technical Implementation**: Sits below all other infrastructure - when everything fails, Access survives

**What You'll Learn**: Design systems that outlast technology trends and framework churn


‚≠ê **Critical Concept**: This principle forms the foundation of all eternal infrastructure design.

## üí° Real-World Implementation Examples

### Multi-Tier IP Detection Pattern
```bash
# Educational example: Multi-tier IP detection
detect_ip() {
  # Tier 1: DNS resolution (fastest)
  ip=$(dig +short myip.opendns.com @resolver1.opendns.com 2>/dev/null)
  
  # Tier 2: HTTP services (fallback)
  if [ -z "$ip" ]; then
    ip=$(curl -s --max-time 10 https://checkip.amazonaws.com/)
  fi
  
  # Tier 3: Alternative HTTP services
  if [ -z "$ip" ]; then
    ip=$(curl -s --max-time 10 https://ipv4.icanhazip.com/)
  fi
  
  # Validation: Filter private IP ranges
  if echo "$ip" | grep -E "^(10\.|172\.(1[6-9]|2[0-9]|3[01])\.|192\.168\.)" >/dev/null; then
    return 1  # Private IP detected
  fi
  
  echo "$ip"
}

```

### Provider Abstraction Pattern  
```bash
# Educational example: Provider abstraction pattern
update_dns() {
  provider="$1"
  domain="$2"
  ip="$3"
  
  # Load provider-specific module
  . "providers/${provider}.sh"
  
  # Call standardized interface
  provider_update_record "$domain" "$ip"
}

```

### Dynamic Module Loading Pattern
```bash
# Educational example: Dynamic module loading
load_providers() {
  for provider_file in providers/*.sh; do
    if [ -f "$provider_file" ]; then
      provider_name=$(basename "$provider_file" .sh)
      . "$provider_file"
      echo "‚úÖ Loaded provider: $provider_name"
    fi
  done
}

```
